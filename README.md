Application name: Great scientists.

This is a single page application (SPA) that teaches about some of great scientists that existed in the past.
Their countries of origin , their field, and the time they lived are also present in this app.

in the home page, one scientist is randomly displayed, it means if you refresh, another scientist will appear. to get the list of all scientists, you go on the great scientist window.

The administrator can add or remove the scientists, he must log in to have the page where to add or remove the scientists.

In this app, I have used the json file as the server. It has two objects. The scientists and adminLogin. The scientist object contains data of the scientists. The adminLogin object has the login data. 

All the data about scientists came from the website https://www.famousscientists.org/
some images of scientists are from https://en.wikipedia.org/
I hope, you will like my SPA.
